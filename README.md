1) The game begins after the player places a bet with the following values to choose from: $5, $10, $20.
2) Player and dealer are given 2 cards each. Dealer's second card will be face down.
3) The player can either choose to "Hit" to be given another card or "Stand" to reveal the dealer's cards.
4) The dealer should at least have a total of 17 to "Stand". Otherwise, dealer must continue to take cards until total is 17 or more.
5) If player's sum goes over 21 or is less than dealer's sum, player loses the bet.
