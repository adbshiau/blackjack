## Getting Started

1) The game begins after the player places a bet with the following values to choose from: $5, $10, $20.
2) The player and dealer are given 2 cards each. Dealer's second card will be face down. Card values:
    - Ace - 11 for starting cards, turns into 1 once dealt with additional cards
    - Face cards - 10
    - Any other card - its pip value
3) The player can either choose to "Hit" to be given another card or "Stand" to reveal the dealer's cards.
4) The dealer should at least have a total of 17 to "Stand". Otherwise, dealer must continue to take cards until total is 17 or more.
5) If player's sum goes over 21 or is less than dealer's sum, player lost and loses the bet.
6) If player's sum is more than dealer's sum, player's bet doubles and is added to the bank.
7) The game keeps going until player's bank runs out.
